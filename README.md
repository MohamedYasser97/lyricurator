# Lyricurator

A bot that scrapes the internet for song lyrics, song names and artists. This program can be either used as a CLI tool to add lyrics to your terminal, or it can be linked with a Twitter account and tweet lyrics automatically.

## Usage

After cloning this repository, you can run lyricurator in its most simple mode of operation with the CLI argument `-nt/--notwitter` which will print random lyrics in the terminal.

In order to send lyrics to Twitter, you have to add the following credentials to the file `auth.json`.

Then you can start lyricurator with the `-t/--twitter` argument and a tweet will be sent.

\* Note that it's mandatory to use one of `-nt` ,`-la`,`-ls`,`-hs`,`-hal`,or `-t`. The rest of the CLI arguments are optional.
